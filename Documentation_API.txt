Test Scenarios Path: 
The test scenarios are organized in the path src/test/java/swagger/pet/store/. In this location, scenarios are categorized by functionality and include validations for various aspects, including:
-Status Codes (statusCode): Verification that API responses return the expected status codes.
-Response Validations: Checking that response data is correct and meets expectations.
-Negative Cases: Tests to ensure the API handles incorrect inputs or conditions properly.

Common Functionality: 
To avoid duplicating code in the tests, I created a file named CommonFunctions.js in the path src/test/java/commons/. This file contains a generic function that facilitates API request execution. 
By using this function, the code in the test scenarios is simplified, and the maintainability of the project is improved.

Files and Data: 
The data required for some of the test scenarios is located in the src/test/resources folder. This location contains JSON files that provide specific data used in the tests. 
Storing data in this folder makes it easy to access and use in the test scenarios.
