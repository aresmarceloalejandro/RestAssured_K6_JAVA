Enviroment Details:

-Connection Impact: Please note that the results may be influenced by the connection on my computer. Variability in network performance could affect the timings reported.
-Setup Issues: There was a problem cloning the repository. To get the environment up and running, it was necessary to add one more file to be able to run it with Maven (I didn't try with docker).
    Add openapi-inflector.yaml file in src/main/resources/
    (
        controllerPackage: io.swagger.petstore.controller
        modelPackage:  io.swagger.petstore.model
        swaggerUrl: openapi.yaml

        exposedSpecOptions:
        useOriginalNotParsed: true

        entityProcessors:
        - json
        - yaml
        - xml

        swaggerProcessors:
        - io.swagger.petstore.utils.HandleAuthUrlProcessor

        rootPath: /api
    )

Test Details:

1. HTTP Request Duration (http_req_duration):
The average time to complete an HTTP request is 4.00 ms, with most requests finishing in less than 7.23 ms.

2. Request Waiting Time (http_req_waiting):
The average waiting time for receiving a response is 2.79 ms, with most requests waiting less than 4.30 ms.

3. Connection Time (http_req_connecting):
The average time to establish a connection is 0.60 ms, indicating a fast and efficient connection setup.

4. Request Sending Time (http_req_sending):
The average time to send the request to the server is low, at 0.72 ms.

5. Response Receiving Time (http_req_receiving):
The average time to receive the server's response is 0.50 ms, indicating quick response times.

6. Request Blocked Time (http_req_blocked):
The average time requests are blocked is 1.57 ms.

7. Iteration Duration (iteration_duration):
The average time to complete a test iteration is 1.3 seconds, with most iterations finishing in less than 2 seconds.

Conclusion: 
The results show efficient performance with generally low response and iteration times. Most requests and operations are completed in very short times, indicating good load handling capacity.
However, maximum times of up to 2 seconds in some iterations suggest there might be areas for further performance optimization.
